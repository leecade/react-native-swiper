/**
 * The most fundamental component for building UI, `View` is a
 * container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and
 * accessibility controls, and is designed to be nested inside other views and
 * to have 0 to many children of any type. `View` maps directly to the native
 * view equivalent on whatever platform React is running on, whether that is a
 * `UIView`, `<div>`, `android.view`, etc.  This example creates a `View` that
 * wraps two colored boxes and custom component in a row with padding.
 *
 * ```
 * <View style={{flexDirection: 'row', height: 100, padding: 20}}>
 *   <View style={{backgroundColor: 'blue', flex: 0.3}} />
 *   <View style={{backgroundColor: 'red', flex: 0.5}} />
 *   <MyCustomComponent {...customProps} />
 * </View>
 * ```
 *
 * `View`s are designed to be used with `StyleSheet`s for clarity and
 * performance, although inline styles are also supported.
