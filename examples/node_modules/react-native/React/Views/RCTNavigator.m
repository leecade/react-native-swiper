/**
 * In general, `RCTNavigator` examines `_currentViews` (which are React child
 * views), and compares them to `_navigationController.viewControllers` (which
 * are controlled by UIKit).
 *
 * It is possible for JavaScript (`_currentViews`) to "get ahead" of native
 * (`navigationController.viewControllers`) and vice versa. JavaScript gets
 * ahead by adding/removing React subviews. Native gets ahead by swiping back,
 * or tapping the back button. In both cases, the other system is initially
 * unaware. And in both cases, `RCTNavigator` helps the other side "catch up".
 *
 * If `RCTNavigator` sees the number of React children have changed, it
 * pushes/pops accordingly. If `RCTNavigator` sees a `UIKit` driven push/pop, it
 * notifies JavaScript that this has happened, and expects that JavaScript will
 * eventually render more children to match `UIKit`. There's no rush for
 * JavaScript to catch up. But if it does rener anything, it must catch up to
 * UIKit. It cannot deviate.
 *
 * To implement this, we need a lock, which we store on the native thread. This
 * lock allows one of the systems to push/pop views. Whoever wishes to
 * "get ahead" must obtain the lock. Whoever wishes to "catch up" must obtain
 * the lock. One thread may not "get ahead" or "catch up" when the other has
 * the lock. Once a thread has the lock, it can only do the following:
 *
 * 1. If it is behind, it may only catch up.
 * 2. If it is caught up or ahead, it may push or pop.
 *
 *
 * ========= Acquiring The Lock ==========
 *
 * JavaScript asynchronously acquires the lock using a native hook. It might be
 * rejected and receive the return value `false`.
 *
 * We acquire the native lock in `shouldPopItem`, which is called right before
 * native tries to push/pop, but only if JavaScript doesn't already have the
 * lock.
 *
 * ========  While JavaScript Has Lock ====
 *
 * When JavaScript has the lock, we have to block all `UIKit` driven pops:
 *
 * 1. Block back button navigation:
 *   - Back button will invoke `shouldPopItem`, from which we return `NO` if
 *   JavaScript has the lock.
 *   - Back button will respect the return value `NO` and not permit
 *   navigation.
 *
 * 2. Block swipe-to-go-back navigation:
 *   - Swipe will trigger `shouldPopItem`, but swipe won't respect our `NO`
 *   return value so we must disable the gesture recognizer while JavaScript
 *   has the lock.
 *
 * ========  While Native Has Lock =======
 *
 * We simply deny JavaScript the right to acquire the lock.
 *
 *
 * ======== Releasing The Lock ===========
 *
 * Recall that the lock represents who has the right to either push/pop (or
 * catch up). As soon as we recognize that the side that has locked has carried
 * out what it scheduled to do, we can release the lock, but only after any
 * possible animations are completed.
 *
 * *IF* a scheduled operation results in a push/pop (not all do), then we can
 * only release the lock after the push/pop animation is complete because
 * UIKit. `didMoveToNavigationController` is invoked when the view is done
 * pushing/popping/animating. Native swipe-to-go-back interactions can be
 * aborted, however, and you'll never see that method invoked. So just to cover
 * that case, we also put an animation complete hook in
 * `animateAlongsideTransition` to make sure we free the lock, in case the
 * scheduled native push/pop never actually happened.
 *
 * For JavaScript:
 * - When we see that JavaScript has "caught up" to `UIKit`, and no pushes/pops
 * were needed, we can release the lock.
 * - When we see that JavaScript requires *some* push/pop, it's not yet done
 * carrying out what it scheduled to do. Just like with `UIKit` push/pops, we
 * still have to wait for it to be done animating
 * (`didMoveToNavigationController` is a suitable hook).
 *

 * percentage.
 *
 * It was critical that we added the dummy view as a subview of the
 * transitionCoordinator's `containerView`, otherwise the animations would not
