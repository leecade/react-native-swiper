# StackTrace-Parser

This parser parses a stack trace from any browser or Node.js and returns an array of hashes representing a line.

## Usage

``` JavaScript
try {
  throw new Error('My error');
} catch(ex) {
  var lines = StackTraceParser.parse(ex.stack);
}
```

Every line contains four properties: `lineNumber`, `methodName`, `file` and `column` (if applicable).

## TODOs

- travis (v0.1)
- check node v0.8 compatibility (v0.1)
- allow to run in browser (v0.2)
